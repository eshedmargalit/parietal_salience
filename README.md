## Parietal Inactivation Analyses
# Eshed Margalit, Moore Lab

The following documentation describes the analysis suite developed by Eshed 
for use in analyzing behavior during the FreeView task performed by subjects
in the Moore Lab.

### Data

Where possible, data is organized in an object-oriented fashion. See the 'classes'
folder for details, but the main object structure is as follows.

Each experiment (recording session) is represented by a DataSet object. DataSet
objects have Trial members, and each Trial has both Fixations and Saccades.

Practically, the entire hierarchy of objects is managed by a top-level cell-array
(e.g., 'datasets') which can be loaded or generated by
```
	datasets = load_experiments();
```

Sequences such as the following exemplify the design philosophy:

datasets{1}.trials{4}.saccades{6}.next_fixation.gbvs_percent_chance_salience

### Methods

A variety of class methods exist to facilitate simple access. Among the most commonly used
are

1. DataSet.get_trials(trial_type), where trial_type can be 'control' or 'inactivation'
2. Trial.get_fixations('left','next'), this call would retrieve all fixations where the
next saccade was to the left on the given Trial


### Pre-Baked Analyses

Listing of available analyses:

1. trial_stats_wrapper: for each dataset provided, compares selected statistics for each trial (e.g., fixation_length, pupil size)

2. trial_stats_wrapper_global_position: Same as (1), but 'left' and 'right' correspond to global left/right, where left corresponds to all pixels on the left half of the image.

3. m_seq_wrapper: for each dataset (or for all datasets combined if 'aggregate' is used as mode), plots the m_sequence (saccade duration vs. pixels spanned)

4. sal_vs_fix_wrapper: plots salience against fixation number, optionally does permutation testing for control/cooling differences

5. compare_centered_raw: for a given dataset and trial, compare the raw and cetnered fixation trajectories

6. temperature_histrogram: plots a 2d histogram of the two temperatures in a given dataset

7. compare_auc: compare area-under-ROC-curve for different salience map formulations

8. saccade_magnitude_distribution: does a histogram binning of saccade magnitudes for a subset of trials

====================

Useful utilities:

From File Exchange:

1. hist2d and Plot2dHist

2. shadedErrorBar

Custom:

1. make_saliency_maps: rough file to loop over all images and compute GBVS maps

2. load_experiments: for all (or a subset of) experiments, create a DataSet object from each. This should probably be your starting point for every analysis.

3. aggregate_trials: given some group of datasets, smush all trials of a given type together
